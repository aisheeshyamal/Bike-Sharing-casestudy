Bike Sharing Case Study
This case study is based on Predictive Analytics and Linear Regression(Machine Learning)
It also consists of a seperate pdf file that has answers to all the subjective questions that were given to us as part of the assignment.
In order to accomplish the conclusion of this case study I have used Python and its various libraries like pandas, matplotlib, sklearn etc.

The tools i have used are Jupyter Notebook , adobe , and MS Excel
to view the data set.



Business Problem and Business Goal: 
The business goal of this case study was to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. And 
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. 
So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end,
and the economy restores.

How to achieve the business goal / What the company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, 
by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, or we can say How well those variables describe the bike demands

Company BoomBikes has planned to reach greater heights by making big profits once the pandemic gets over. Their intention is also to cater the 
needs of the 

Final Recommendations for the company:
- The months - 5(May) and 9(Sep) should be considered by the company as they have a higher demand as compared to other months.
- With an increase in temperature the demand also increases, hence it should keep track of the weather conditions.
- During Sundays , Holidays , Spring, Light rains or when the weather is hot and humid the demand decreases.
- During the Winter season the demand rises, hence it should be well prepared to meet the high demand.
